=== Using SWT in a plug-in project
    
The SWT library is packaged as an Eclipse plug-in.
If you create an Eclipse plug-in and want to use SWT you have to specify a dependency to the `org.eclipse.swt` plug-in in the corresponding manifest file.

=== Using SWT in Java projects
	
The usage of SWT is not restricted to Eclipse plug-ins and applications . 
To use it in normal Java programs, you have to add the _JAR_ files, which contain the SWT implementation for the corresponding OS, to the classpath of your Java application.
	
To use  SWT in stand-alone applications, you need to have the SWT library available. 
If you are not using an automated build system, you can download the SWT library from the following URL:
http://www.eclipse.org/swt/.
	
This ZIP file contains a _swt.jar_ file which you need to add to the _classpath_ of your SWT project.
