== Find the plug-in for a certain class

You frequently have to find the plug-in for a given class.
The Eclipse IDE makes it easy to find the plug-in for a class.
After enabling the _Include all plug-ins from target into Java Search_ setting in the Eclipse IDE preferences you can use the _Open Type_ dialog (kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + T]) to find the plug-in for a class.
The _JAR_ file is shown in this dialog and the prefix of the JAR file is typically the plug-in which contains this class.
