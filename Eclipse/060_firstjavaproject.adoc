== Create your first Java program

The following section describes how to create a minimal Java application using Eclipse. 
It is tradition in the programming world to create a small program which writes "Hello World" to the console. 
We will adapt this tradition and will write "Hello Eclipse!" to the console.

=== Create project

This {textselfreference} uses the naming convention that the project is named the same as the top-level package in the project.

Select menu:File[New > Java project] from the menu. 
Enter `com.vogella.eclipse.ide.first` as the project name and press the btn:[Finish] button to create the project.

[TIP]
====
Reverse domain names should be used for project (and packages) names to prevent name clashes. 
For example,  is relatively unlikely that another company uses the `com.vogella` package, because this is the reverse URL of the vogella GmbH company.
====

A new project is created and displayed as a folder. 
Open the `com.vogella.eclipse.ide.first` folder and explore the content of this folder.

=== Create package

[TIP]
====
A good naming convention is to use the same name for the top level package and the project. 
For example, if you name your project `com.example.javaproject` you should also use `com.example.javaproject` as the top-level package name.
====


Create the `com.vogella.eclipse.ide.first` package, select the `src` folder, right-click on it and select menu:New[Package].

If necessary adjust the name of your new package in the dialog and press the btn:[Finish] button.

=== Create Java class

Right-click on your package and select menu:New[Class] to create a Java class.

Enter `MyFirstClass` as the class name and select the _public static void main (String[] args)_ checkbox.

Press the btn:[Finish] button.

This creates a new file and opens the Java _editor_.
Change the class based on the following listing.

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstexample/MyFirstClass.java[]
----

You could also directly create new packages via this dialog. 
If you enter a new package in this dialog, it is created automatically.

=== Run your project in Eclipse

Now run your code. 
Either right-click on your Java class in the _Package Explorer_ or right-click in the Java class and select menu:Run-as[Java application].

Eclipse will run your Java program. 
You should see the output in the _Console_ view.

Congratulations! You created your first Java project, a package, a Java class and you ran this program inside Eclipse.
