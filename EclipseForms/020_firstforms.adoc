== Forms Example

=== First Example

Create a new Eclipse RCP project called _de.vogella.rcp.intro.forms_. 
Use the "RCP Application with a view" as a template. 
Add a dependency to "org.eclipse.ui.forms" in your manifest file via the _Dependencies_ tab. 

Change the generated `View` class to the following. 
This creates a re-sizable table in a form with a button on the right side of it.

[source,java]
----
include::res/forms/View.java[]
----

The resulting application should look like the following:

=== Adding a command to the menu

You can also add a command to the menu of the form. 
For this, define a command with a handler.
Add this command to a popup menu contribution as for example in the following plugin.xml.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/menu/plugin.xml[]
----

Change the view to display the command in the form and you should see the command in your form. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/menu/View.java[]
----
