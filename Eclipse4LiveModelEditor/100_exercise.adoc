== Optional Exercise: Using the model spy

To test the application model dynamics, integrate the model spy and its dependencies into the run configuration of your application.

[NOTE]
====
The model spy is a debug tool and not intended to be used in a productive application. 
So it might happen that this exercise does not work, or that you see additional exceptions in your log file, caused by the tool.
====





=== Add the spies to your target platform

Add the model spies to your target platform. 
See <<tutorial_installation_e4tools>> for the update site.

[WARNING]
====
If you do not add the e4 spies to your target platform, you cannot use it in your RCP application.
====

=== Adding the model spy to your runtime configuration

Open the run configuration of your product via the menu:Run[Run Configurations...] menu entry and add the `org.eclipse.e4.tools.model.spy` plug-in and its dependencies to it.

If you use the filter you have to remove it before the _Add Required Plug-ins_ becomes active again.

Press the btn:[Validate] button to ensure that all dependencies are included.

=== Use the model spy

After you have added the new plug-ins to your run configuration press the btn:[Run] button in the run configuration you just added.

[WARNING]
====
Do not start the application now via the product. 
Starting via the product resets your changes in the runtime configuration.
====

Start your application and use the kbd:[Shift+Alt+F9] shortcut to open the model spy.

[INFO]
====
The code of the model spy adds this key binding to your application by modifying your application model at runtime. 
If you already defined key bindings this process might fail.
====

Use the model spy to change the runtime application model. 
For example, add a part (with a label) or change the size of the window. 
All changes should become immediately visible (except changes for new menu entries, due to a bug).

=== Cleanup - remove model spy from your run configuration

After testing with the tool enabled, start your application again from your product configuration file to remove the model spy plug-in from your run configuration.

[WARNING]
====
If you leave the model spy included in your run configuration, it might cause side effects.
For example, in the past it created exceptions if key bindings were present in the application.
