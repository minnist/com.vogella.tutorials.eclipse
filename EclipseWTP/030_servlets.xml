== Exercise: Create and run a servlet

=== Target
		In this exercise you create a servlet
			which works as a webpage
			counter. This
			servlet keeps track of the
			number of visitors of a
			webpage. The
			servlet persists the number
			of visitors in a text
			file.
		
	

=== Create web project
		
			Create a
			new
			_Dynamic Web Project_
			called
			_com.vogella.web.filecounter_
			by selecting
			menu:File[New > Other... > Web > Dynamic Web Project]
			.

				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		
image::wtp_first_project20.png" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		
			Press twice the
			_Next_
			button and select the
			_Generate web.xml deployment descriptor_
			on the last page.

				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		
			Afterwards press the
			_Finish_
			button.
		
		
			If Eclipse asks you, to switch to the
			_Java EE Perspective_
			answer yes.
		
		
			A new project has been created with the standard structure of
			a
			Java
			web application. The
			<filename class="directory">WEB-INF/lib_
			directory holds all
			the JAR files that the Java web
			application
			requires.
		
	


=== Creating Data Access Object
		
			Create a new package called
			_com.vogella.web.filecounter.dao_
			.
		
		
			Create the following new Java class to read and write the
			counter value to and from the file.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/counter/FileDao.java[]
----
		
	


=== Creating the Servlet
		
			Create a servlet. Right-click on your project and select
			menu:New[Servlet]
			.
			Enter the following data.
		
		
image::wtp_first_project40.png" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		
image::wtp_first_project50.png" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		Press finish.
		
			You could also create a servlet without the wizard. The wizard
			creates a Java class
			which extends the
			`javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet`
			and
			adds the servlet
			settings to the
			_web.xml_
			file.
		
		Enter the following code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/counter/FileCounter.java[]
----
		
		
			This code will read the counter from a file on the server and
			return plain text to the browser. The servlet will increase the
			counter if the user was inactive for 5 seconds.
		
	


=== Deployment of the servlet
		
			You application must be deployed to the server and started there.
			Select your servlet or your project, right-click on it and select
			menu:Run As[Run on Server]
			from the context menu and select your existing server.
		
		
image::wtp_first_project60.png" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		

		
			Ensure your servlet is selected to run on the
			server.
		
		
image::wtp_first_project70.png" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		

		NOTE:
			In case you get the error "The Tomcat server configuration at
				\Servers\Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost-config is missing. Check
				the server for errors.", simply delete the existing server
				configuration and create a new one.
			
		</note>
		
			Press the
			_Finish_
			button.
		
	

=== Validate the deployment
		
			If the deployment was successfully you should be able to
			access
			your servlet via the following URL:
			http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.web.filecounter/FileCounter
		
	
		The servlet you return the number of times it was accessed. If
		you
		wait 5 seconds and
		refresh the browser, the
		number should
		increase.

		Congratulations. You created your first working servlet with
		Eclipse WTP!
