== The Eclipse user interface

=== Toolbar

The application toolbar contains actions which you typically
perform, e.g., creating Java resources or running
Java projects. It
also allows you to switch between perspectives.

=== Perspectives in Eclipse
		
Eclipse provides different
_perspectives_
for different tasks.
The available
_perspectives_
depend on your installation.
For Java development you
usually use the
_Java Perspective_, but Eclipse has much more predefined
_perspectives_, e.g., the
_Debug_
_perspective_.
		
Eclipse allows you to
switch to another
_perspective_
via the
menu:Window+Perspective[Open Perspective > Other...]
menu entry.
		
		
Open
editors
are typically shared between
perspectives, i.e., if you have
an
editor
open in the
_Java_
perspective
for a certain class and switch to the
_Debug_
perspective, this
_editor_
stays open.
		
		

You can switch
_Perspectives_
via the
menu:Window+Perspective[Open Perspective > Other...]
menu entry.
		
		
The main perspectives used for Java development are the
_Java_
perspective
and the
_Debug_
perspective.

The Java perspective can be opened via
menu:Window+Perspective[Open Perspective > Java].

On the left hand side, this perspective shows the
_Package Explorer_
view,
which allows you to browse your
_projects_
and to select the
components you want to open in an editor via a
double-click.
		
For example, to open
a Java source file, open the tree under
`src`,
select the corresponding
_.java_
file and double-click it. This will open the file in the
default Java
_editor_.
		
The following picture shows the default Java
perspective. The
_Package Explorer_
view
is on the left. In the middle
you
see the
open
editors. Several
editors
are stacked in the same container and you can
switch between them by
clicking on the corresponding tab.
Via drag and
drop you can move an
editor to a new position in the Eclipse IDE.

To the right and below the editor area you find more
_views_
which were considered useful by the developer of the
perspective. For
example, the
_Javadoc_
view
shows the Javadoc of the selected class or method.
		
=== Resetting and customizing a perspective
		
A common problem is that you changed the arrangement of views and editors in your _perspective_ and you want to restore its original state. 
For example, you might have closed a view.
You can reset a _perspective_ to its original state via the menu:Window[Perspective > Reset Perspective...] menu entry.
		
You can change the layout and content within a perspective by opening or closing parts and by re-arranging them.
		
To open a new part in your current perspective, use the menu:Window[Show View > Other...] menu entry. 
This opens the _Show View_ dialog which allows you to search for certain _parts_.

If you want to reset your current perspective to its default, use the menu:Window[Reset Perspective] menu entry.
		
You can save the currently selected perspective via menu:Window+Perspective[Save Perspective As...].

The menu:Window+Perspective[Customize Perspective...] menu entry allows you to adjust the selected perspective. For example, you can hide or show toolbar and menu entries.
